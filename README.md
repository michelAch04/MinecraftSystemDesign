# MinecraftSystemDesign
Hey! This repository is a project I worked on in the Object-Oriented Design course in my 3rd year as a computer engineer.
The project is about reverse-engineering Minecraft, our beloved childhood game, and re-designing its system and requirements. 
Obviously this does not contain the whole Minecraft system since it is huge, but it is very good practice for designing software systems in the future.
